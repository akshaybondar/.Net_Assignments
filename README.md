# .Net_Assignments

# Day2_Assignment 1(Employee)

Create a Class Employee with te following specifications

Properties=>

	string Name -> no blank names should be allowed

	int EmpNo -> must be readonly and autogenerated

	decimal Basic -> must be between some range

	short DeptNo -> must be > 0

Methods=>

	decimal GetNetSalary() -> returns calculated net salary 

	(Use any formula to get net salary based on Basic salary)


Create overloaded constructors to accept initial values for Employee obj

	Employee o1 = new Employee("Amol",123465, 10);

	Employee o2 = new Employee("Amol",123465);

	Employee o3 = new Employee("Amol");

	Employee o4 = new Employee();

	EmpNo must be autogenerated ... i.e.

	first object should automatically get EmpNo 1

	second object should automatically get EmpNo 2

	third object should automatically get EmpNo 3

	...and so on...

Test Cases

	Employee o1 = new Employee();

	Employee o2 = new Employee();

	Employee o3 = new Employee();

	cw(o1.EmpNo);

	cw(o2.EmpNo);

	cw(o3.EmpNo);

	cw(o3.EmpNo);

	cw(o2.EmpNo);

	cw(o1.EmpNo);

# Day3_Assignment 2(Inheritance)
Create the following classes.

Employee

   Prop	

	string Name -> no blanks

	int EmpNo -> readonly, autogenerated

	short DeptNo -> > 0

	abstract decimal Basic 

   Methods

	abstract decimal CalcNetSalary()

Manager : Employee

   Prop

	string Designation -> cant be blank

GeneralManager : Manager

   Prop

 	string Perks -> no validations

CEO : Employee

      Make CalNetSalary() a sealed method

NOTE : 

	Overloaded constructors in all classes calling their base class constructor 

	All classes must implement IDbFunctions interface

	All classes to override the abstract members defined in the base class(Employee). 

	Basic property to have different validation in different classes.


--------------------------------------------------------

# Day5_Assignment 3(Array)

1. Create an array of Employee class objects

    Accept details for all Employees

    Display the Employee with highest Salary

    Accept EmpNo to be searched. Display all details for that employee.

2. CDAC has certain number of batches. each batch has certain number of students

	accept number of batches from the user. for each batch accept number of students.
    create an array to store mark for each student. 
    accept the marks.
    display the marks.

3. Create a struct Student with the following properties. Put in appropriate validations.

	string Name
	int RollNo
	decimal Marks

Create a parameterized constructor.

Create an array to accept details for 5 students.
